## Overview

The **Water Consumption Prediction System** is a deep learning-powered tool designed to monitor and forecast water consumption patterns in rural areas. Using an LSTM model implemented with TensorFlow, the project aids in sustainable resource management by providing accurate predictions based on historical data.

---

## Features

- **LSTM Model**: Predicts water consumption patterns using TensorFlow.  
- **Customizable Input**: Accepts various water consumption datasets for tailored predictions.  
- **Scalable Design**: Can be adapted for different regions with diverse water usage patterns.
